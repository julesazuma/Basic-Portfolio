     <h2>About Me</h2>
    <br>
    <p>Hello, my name is Jules Azuma. I am a web developer currently in training from the Seattle, Washington area. I am very passionate about web development and design, and I look forward to acquiring new skills so that I can utilize my creativity and build amazing websites and apps that really stand out!</p>
    <p>My hobbies include coding practice, sports, working out, video games, cars, and of course last but certainly not least spending time with my family! I have lived in Seattle my whole life, but I have visited many places around the world. I love traveling and experiencing different cultures and I hope to use those experiences to inspire myself to make beautiful web pages!</p>
